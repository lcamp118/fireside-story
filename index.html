    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
    And I was sitting on the couch, watching Netflix.<br>
When suddenly a commercial came on. "OH NO!!", I screamed.<br>
"I pay good money to not have to have people try and sell me things, god damnit."<br>
I was so angry!! I threw my remote across the room and it exploded against the wall into several pieces.<br>
"Now what will I do?" I said, "I can't even turn the commercial off!!"<br>
</p>
<p>
  That was the last straw. I had had it. I erupted into a screaming fit of rage which really scared my dog.<br>
  She then started running all around the house and accidentally knocked over a lamp, which in turn, fell into the<br>
  vodka bottle I was drinking and now the floor was on fire. Oh. My. God.<br>
  "Well that escalated quickly", I said while I rushed to get the fire extinguisher. I was able to stop the fire before<br>
  it got too big!! Thank goodness!!<br>
