    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>
    And I was sitting on the couch, watching Netflix.<br>
When suddenly a commercial came on. "OH NO!!", I screamed.<br>
"I pay good money to not have to have people try and sell me things, god damnit."<br>
I was so angry!! I threw my remote across the room and it exploded against the wall into several pieces.<br>
"Now what will I do?" I said, "I can't even turn the commercial off!!"<br>
